# ChildhoodCancerDataInitiative-CatchERRy
This script will take a CCDI metadata manifest file and try to blindly fix the most common errors before the validation step. 

This is a refactoring of the [CCDI-CatchERR](https://github.com/CBIIT/ChildhoodCancerDataInitiative-CatchERR) code into python.

To run the script on a CCDI template, run the following command in a terminal where python is installed for help.
